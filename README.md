# TheoMLInit

TheoMLInit (short for TheoTown ModLoader Initializer) is a bootstrap for Theotown.
TheoMLInit can be installed by running the jar without arguments, such as so:

	java -jar theomlinit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

or

	java -Dgame_dir=/path/to/theotown/directory -jar theomlinit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

It will automatically install the starloader-launcher version 20221221 (snapshot of
starloader-launcher 4.X) and hook itself to be run whenever "TheoTown64" is executed.

## Requirements

 - Linux (other OSes are unavailable to me and cannot be tested by me)
 - Java 11 or beyond (Java 17 or beyond is highly recommended)

## Misc

Theotown has a special place in my heart, mostly because it almost was the game
that I would mainly mod in my spare time. This however did not happen and I slowly
drifted away from the Theotown community. Still, after many years I have a strong connection
to the game and a sense that I owe it something. That something is TheoMLInit - feel free
to do anything you'd like with it (assuming you are honoring it's license of course).

Perhaps, just perhaps, Theotown will have a notable modding community. It's regular
community is certainly large enough to support one I'd say. But that is probably the
optimist in me - most likely my Theotown modding adventures will be just as lonesome
as my Galimulator ones.
